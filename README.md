## How implementation differed from planning

When planning I envisoned each user model to have a list of comments. This way, comments would be linked to a specific user, but during implementation I changed it so that comments store a username, making it easier to display usernames alongside comments. All the data would be retrieved simply by fetching all comments.

## Technical Issues Encountered

1. I ran into an issue where I would update a comment but it would not update the state. This was caused by forgetting to set the state whenever the comment would change (within the onChange function of the input).

2. I encountered an issue where I wasn't sure how to retrieve the comments from the database. I figured out that I could create a get route and call the route using fetch in my react component.

3. I encountered an issue where I was not able to dynamically delete a comment or rating from the database. I solved it by passing in the comments ID and searching for it within the database and then deleting it. 

## Hardest part / MVL 

The hardest part of the project was setting up the state correctly in my React. I am new to React and wasnâ€™t sure how props/state worked. The most valuable learning experience was being able to create a backend and connect it to a React front end.
